Navigate to where you downloaded `Blender_io_EDM.zip` and select the file.
Blender will install `io_EDM` to a standard location, then show the newly
installed addon in the list. Simple then check the 'Enabled' box to 
finish installing:

You can also click 'Save User Settings' to keep the addon loaded next time you
start blender - If you do this, it will not interfere with any other uses of
Blender, but will leave the edm-specific user interfaces in place until you
disable the addon.
